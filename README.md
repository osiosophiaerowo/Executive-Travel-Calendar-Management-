# Executive Travel & Calendar Management (London-New York)
International travel coordination and dual-time zone calendar management for a London-to-New York business trip.

# Project: Planning a Business Trip from London to New York

## What this project is about
I acted as a Virtual Assistant for an executive traveling from London to New York for a three-day business trip. This project involved more than just booking flights; I managed her entire stay, including her attendance at a major Tech Conference, a high-priority call with her lawyer, and an important dinner meeting with a client. I handled everything from the moment she left London until she arrived back home on the "Red-eye" flight.

## My Main Goals

**​Handled Time Zone Change:** Since New York is 5 hours behind London, I made sure all flights, the tech conference, and the dinner meeting were set in the correct local time so there were no missed appointments and there was no confusion.

**​Organizing the Travel Details:** I put the flight numbers, departure/arrival times, airport terminals, and even her seat number right in the calendar. This ensured she had every detail for her London to New York trip in one place without having to look through her emails.

**​Coordinating the UK Team Sync (Zoom):** I scheduled a Zoom meeting for the UK Team Sync. I ensured the Zoom link was directly in the calendar invite so she could join with one click from New York, perfectly timed to catch the London team before they finished their day.

**High-Priority Lawyer Call:** I successfully scheduled a critical Legal Call during the Tech Conference. I had to coordinate this specifically to match London's office hours while the executive was in New York, ensuring she could step out at the perfect time to take the call without missing the main conference highlights.

**​Dinner Meeting Details:** For the dinner, I included the restaurant name, the exact location link on her calendar so she could click for GPS directions, and the reservation name it was booked under. This removed any guesswork when she arrived at the venue.

**​Using Colors to Stay Organized:** I used a specific color system so she could look at her phone and instantly know the nature of each event:
***Blue:*** Flights*
*​**Red:*** Priority*
***​Yellow:*** Dinner*
*​**Green:*** Prep*
*​**Grey:*** Conference*

## Proof of My Work

**1. Flight From London to New York**

For the flight on Tuesday, 3 February, I organized all travel information for British Airways Flight 173 from London Heathrow Airport to John F. Kennedy International Airport into a single calendar entry for Sarah. I included the full flight details showing a departure from London Heathrow Airport at 11:20 AM Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and an arrival at New York John F. Kennedy International Airport at 2:35 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST). 

I ensured every logistical detail was present, including the confirmation number BA12345, Terminal 5 for the departure, Terminal 7 for the arrival, and Seat 14B which is an aisle seat. Additionally, I set a reminder for thirty minutes before the event and added a proactive note for the executive to have her passport and New York City hotel address ready for the immigration process to ensure a smooth transition.

**2. The Dinnner Meeting In New York**

I scheduled a dinner meeting for Sarah and Mike, who is an investor, on Tuesday, 3 February, from 7:00 PM to 7:30 PM at The Grill located at 99 East 52nd Street, New York, New York 10022. I included all essential details in the calendar invitation, specifically noting that the reservation is held under the name "Sarah Smith" and that the required dress code is business casual attire for this meeting with potential New York City investors. 

I included a clickable map link to the restaurant location so she can easily access navigation directions, and I set a notification alert for thirty minutes before the event to ensure she has sufficient time to arrive at the venue.

**3. The Busy Day In New York**

I coordinated a full day of high-priority activities for Sarah, starting with a Focus Time and Preparation session at 7:30 AM at The High Line Hotel followed by a United Kingdom Team Sync at 8:15 AM. I specifically scheduled this Zoom video call to align with the time back home in London, where it was 1:15 PM, ensuring the team could meet during their standard business hours. 

I blocked out the majority of her day from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM for the New York City Tech Innovation Conference at the Javits Center located at 429 11th Avenue, New York, New York 10001. Within that conference schedule, I organized a high-priority Lawyer Call at 2:00 PM Eastern Standard Time, which I carefully aligned with the London closing time of 7:00 PM to ensure the legal team was still available to speak.

## Conclusion 

I coordinated a full day of high-priority activities for Sarah, starting with a Focus Time and Preparation session at 7:30 AM at The High Line Hotel followed by a United Kingdom Team Sync at 8:15 AM. I specifically scheduled this Zoom video call to align with the time back home in London, where it was 1:15 PM, ensuring the team could meet during their standard business hours. 

I blocked out the majority of her day from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM for the New York City Tech Innovation Conference at the Javits Center located at 429 11th Avenue, New York, New York 10001. Within that conference schedule, I organized a high-priority Lawyer Call at 2:00 PM Eastern Standard Time, which I carefully aligned with the London closing time of 7:00 PM to ensure the legal team was still available to speak. 

By managing these time zone overlaps, I ensured Sarah remained connected to her London operations while attending her New York City engagements.
