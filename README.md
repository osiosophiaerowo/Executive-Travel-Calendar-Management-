# Executive Travel & Calendar Management (London-New York)
International travel coordination and dual-time zone calendar management for a London-to-New York business trip.

# Project: Planning a Business Trip from London to New York

## 📖 What this project is about
I acted as a Virtual Assistant for an executive traveling from London to New York for a three-day business trip. This project involved more than just booking flights; I managed her entire stay, including her attendance at a major Tech Conference, a high-priority call with her lawyer, and an important dinner meeting with a client. I handled everything from the moment she left London until she arrived back home on the "Red-eye" flight.

## 🎯 My Main Goals
* **Handled Time Zone Change:** Since New York is 5 hours behind London, I made sure all flights, the tech conference, and the dinner meetings were set in the correct local time so there were no missed appointments and there was no confusion.
* **Organizing the Travel Details:** I put the flight numbers, airport terminals, and seat numbers right in the calendar so she didn't have to go looking through her emails.
* **Using Colors to Stay Organized:** I used a color system so she could look at her phone and instantly see what was a flight (Blue) and what was a "Must-Attend" meeting (Red).

## 🛠️ What I did
1. **Full Trip Coordination:** Managed the travel from the first flight out of London to the overnight flight back home.
2. **Detailed Scheduling:** Organized her time at the conference and set up her private meetings.
3. **Clear Directions:** Every event has a specific address so she could just click it and get a map.
4. **Buffer Time:** I gave her time to get from the airport to her meetings and dinner so she was never rushed.
