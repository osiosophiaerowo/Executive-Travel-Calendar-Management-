# Executive Travel & Calendar Management (London-New York)
International travel coordination and dual-time zone calendar management for a London-to-New York business trip.

# Project: Planning a Business Trip from London to New York

## What this project is about
I acted as a Virtual Assistant for an executive traveling from London to New York for a three-day business trip. This project involved more than just booking flights; I managed her entire stay, including her attendance at a major Tech Conference, a high-priority call with her lawyer, and an important dinner meeting with a client. I handled everything from the moment she left London until she arrived back home on the "Red-eye" flight.

## My Main Goals

**​Handled Time Zone Change:** Since New York is 5 hours behind London, I made sure all flights, the tech conference, and the dinner meeting were set in the correct local time so there were no missed appointments and there was no confusion.

**​Organizing the Travel Details:** I put the flight numbers, departure/arrival times, airport terminals, and even her seat number (14B) right in the calendar. This ensured she had every detail for her London to New York trip in one place without having to look through her emails.

**​Coordinating the UK Team Sync (Zoom):** I scheduled a Zoom meeting for the UK Team Sync. I ensured the Zoom link was directly in the calendar invite so she could join with one click from New York, perfectly timed to catch the London team before they finished their day.

**High-Priority Lawyer Call:** I successfully scheduled a critical Legal Call during the Tech Conference. I had to coordinate this specifically to match London's office hours while the executive was in New York, ensuring she could step out at the perfect time to take the call without missing the main conference highlights.

**​Dinner Meeting Details:** For the dinner, I included the restaurant name, the exact location link on her calendar so she could click for GPS directions, and the reservation name it was booked under. This removed any guesswork when she arrived at the venue.

**​Using Colors to Stay Organized:** I used a specific color system so she could look at her phone and instantly know the nature of each event:
***Blue:*** Flights*
*​**Red:*** Priority*
***​Yellow:*** Dinner*
*​**Green:*** Prep*
*​**Grey:*** Conference*
